# Job Tracker

A client-side job application tracker built with React 19, TypeScript, and Vite. Manage your pipeline from wishlist to offer in a kanban-style board, with search filtering and an analytics dashboard.

## Features

- **Kanban board** — five-stage pipeline: Wishlist → Applied → Interviewing → Offer → Rejected
- **Drag and drop** — reorder and move cards between columns
- **Add / edit / delete jobs** — modal forms with full CRUD
- **Search & filter** — real-time filtering across all job fields
- **Analytics view** — conversion rate, rejection rate, and a per-stage bar chart
- **Multi-user auth** — username-based login with per-user job isolation; state persisted in `localStorage`

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| UI | React 19 |
| Language | TypeScript 6 |
| Bundler | Vite 8 |
| State | `useReducer` + Context API |
| Styling | Vanilla CSS (custom properties) |

No external UI libraries or state management packages — intentionally lean.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

```bash
npm run build    # type-check + production bundle
npm run preview  # serve the production build locally
npm run lint     # ESLint
```

## Architecture Notes

State lives in a single `AppState` tree (`jobs`, `filteredJobs`, `auth`) managed by `appReducer`. All mutations go through typed `AppAction` dispatches — no direct state writes anywhere. `filteredJobs` is always derived from `jobs` inside the reducer, so filtering and auth-scoping are applied consistently on every action.

Jobs are scoped by `owner` (the logged-in username), so multiple users can share the same `localStorage` bucket without seeing each other's data.
